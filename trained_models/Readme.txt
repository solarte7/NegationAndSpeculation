Trained models on the NUBES corpus
==================================================================================

We provide deep learning-based trained models to perform negation and uncertainty detection.

These models can be downloaded from this link:

You can use the scripts "loadBiLSTM-CRF.ipynb" and "loadBERT.ipynb"  to evaluate and exploit these models. These files are found in the validation directory.



You can also access these scripts using the following URLs:
