Validating the Cancer dataset:
==================================================================================


1) To perform Validation, we used trained models with the NUBES corpus.
   These models can be downloaded from this link:

2) The directory "Validation with BiLSTM"  contains two files:

   - loadBiLSTM-CRF.ipynb: This script allows us to load a trained BiLSTM-CRF model and validate a set of sentences.

   -  Validation_BiLSTM.ipynb: This script allows us to load a trained BiLSTM-CRF model and validate a complete dataset (such as The cancer dataset).  
      The dataset to be validated must be pre-processed preoviosly using the sripts provided in the directory Pre-processing.
      
      
   
   
3)    The directory "Validation with BERT"  contains two files:

      -  loadBERT.ipynb: This script allows us to load a trained BERT-based model and validate a set of sentences.

      -  Validation_BERT.ipynb: This script allows us to load a trained BERT-based model and validate a complete dataset...
