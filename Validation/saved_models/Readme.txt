To perform Validation,  we saved models trained with the NUBES corpus.
These models can be downloaded from this link:

===================================================================================

Four Python notebooks are provided in this directory to perform validation:

1) <b>Load_BiLSTM:</b> This script allows to load a trained BiLSTM model and validate a set of sentences manually.

2) <b>Valitation_BiLSTM</b>: This script allows to load a trained BiLSTM model and validate a complete dataset (The cancer dataset). This script automatically calculate performed metrics. The dataset to be validated must be pre-processed preoviosly using the sripts provided in the directory Pre-processing.

3) <b>Load_BERT</b>: This script allows to load a trained BERT-based model and validate a set of sentences manually.

4) <b>Valitation_BiLSTM</b>: This script allows to load a trainebasd BERT-based model and validate a complete dataset. This script automatically calculate performed metrics.
