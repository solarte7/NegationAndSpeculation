# NegationAndSpeculation
The detection of speculation and negation in medical texts is paramount as otherwise extracted information can be incorrectly identified as real or factual events.<br>
This repository contains a deep learning-based approach for speculation and negation detection from clinical texts written in Spanish. This approach performs negation and speculation detection as a sequence labeling task.The proposed approach explores two deep learning methods: 
 <ul>

 <li> Bidirectional Long Short memory (BiLSTM)
 <li> Bidirectional Encoder Representation for Transformers (BERT)  
</ul>
